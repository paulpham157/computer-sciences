[Verse 1: Paul Stanley]
Tonight, I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness, there's so much I wanna do
And tonight, I wanna lay it at your feet
'Cause, girl, I was made for you
And, girl, you were made for me

[Chorus]
I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

[Verse 2: Paul Stanley]
Tonight, I wanna see it in your eyes
Feel the magic, there's something that drives me wild
And tonight, we're gonna make it all come true
'Cause, girl, you were made for me
And, girl, I was made for you
