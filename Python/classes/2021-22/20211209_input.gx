Society in every state is a blessing, but
government, even in its best state, is but a
necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable
one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the
same miseries by a government, which we might
expect in a country without government, our
calamity is heightened by reflecting that we
furnish the means by which we suffer.
