DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
OVER THE FIELDS WE GO LAUGHING ALL THE WAY
BELLS ON BOB-TAIL RING MAKING SPIRITS BRIGHT
WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE AND SING A SLEIGHING SONG TONIGHT
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
A DAY OR TWO AGO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE A RIDE
AND SOON MISS FANNY BRIGHT WAS SEATED BY MY SIDE
THE HORSE WAS LEAN AND LANK MISFORTUNE SEEMED HIS LOT
HE GOT INTO A DRIFTED BANK AND WE GOT UPSET
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
A DAY OR TWO AGO THE STORY I MUST TELL
I WENT OUT ON THE SNOW AND ON MY BACK I FELL
A GENT WAS RIDING BY IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
HE LAUGHED AS THERE I SPRAWLING LIE BUT QUICKLY DROVE AWAY
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
NOW THE GROUND IS WHITE GO IT WHILE YOU'RE YOUNG
TAKE THE GIRLS TONIGHT AND SING THIS SLEIGHING SONG
JUST GET A BOB-TAILED BAY TWO-FORTY AS HIS SPEED
HITCH HIM TO AN OPEN SLEIGH AND CRACK YOU'LL TAKE THE LEAD
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
JINGLE BELLS JINGLE BELLS JINGLE ALL THE WAY
O WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH
