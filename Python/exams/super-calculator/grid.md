# INFINITE IMPROBABILITY SUPER CALCULATOR -- EVALUATION GRID

## STYLE (3 point)

- Correct use of `if __main__:` and `main()` function: 1 point
- Coherent naming style for variables and functions, ie. all `snake_case` or all `camelCase`: 1 point
- Only local variables, except few used as *constants*, defined in the top of the file, and with names `ALL_CAPITAL`: 1 point

## I/O  (11 point)

- Use of `try/except`: 1 point
- Use of `try/except` around a *small* fragment of code: 1 point
- Correct exception (`OSError`): 1 point
- Correct split of operands and operators: 2 point
- Minimum number of integer conversion (convert operators only once): 1 point
- Storing operands and operators *together* (eg. list of two lists, tuple of 2 tuples, two lists with same indexes): 2 points
- Storing the list of pairs operand/operators in a suitable format (eg. list of tuples): 2 point
- Output in the correct format (not necessarily correct values): 1 point

## ALGORITHM (12 points)

- Correct implementation of operator '+': 2 point
- Correct implementation of operator '-': 2 point
- Correct implementation of operator '*': 2 point
- Correct computation of 1 operation in 1 line: 2 point
- Correct computation of all operations in 1 line: 2 point
- Correct computation of all operations in all lines: 2 point
